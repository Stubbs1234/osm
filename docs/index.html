<h1 id=introduction>Introduction</h1>
<p>This library is intended to provide a simple object-oriented interface to the
information held in Online Scout Manager.</p>
<p>You should note that this software and its distribution method is in its
early days (in 2020) and so you should not hesitate to contact the developer if
you have problems (andrew at atf dot me dot uk).</p>

<p>The basic idea of the library is that the objects of interest in Online Scout
Manager are represented by PHP objects with straightforward properties.  The
caller does not have to concern him or herself with API calls: just access the
property you want and the API call will take place in the background.</p>

<p>Another principle is that we minimise the number of calls made to the API.
These are expensive to make as they involve a round trip to a remote server;
also, we wish to avoid putting an excessive load on the OSM web server.
We do not make an API call until the information it supplies is needed, and we
store the results of API calls for the lifetime of the OSM object.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<h2 id=composer-install>Using Composer</h2>
<p>If you are new to Composer you will need to install it first.  That is
outside the scope of this document; a good start is to look at the "Getting
Started" section of <a href=https://getcomposer.org/>getcomposer.org</a> (but
consider a <a href=#manual-install>manual install</a> of <i>atf/osm</i>
instead).</p>

<p>To include <i>atf/osm</i> in a new project the minimal composer.json
required is:
<pre><code>
{
    "repositories": [
        {"type": "vcs",
         "url": "https://github.com/atf2/osm"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "atf/osm": ">=0.1.0"
    }
}
</code></pre>
(note the '2' after 'atf' in the url!)

<h2 id=manual-install>Manual Installation</h2>
<p>Since all the functionality of <i>atf/osm</i> is contained in a single php
script you can just download the script from GitHub
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atf2/osm/master/src/OSM/OSM.php"
   title="Right click and 'Save Link as' or 'Save target as'">here</a> and
include it in your project as required.  You will, of course, miss out on the
automatic updates and so on which the <a href=#composer-install>Composer</a>
method would give.

<h1 id=overview>Overview</h1>
<h2>Connecting to the API</h2>
<p>The first thing your program must do is create an object of class OSM (full
name \atf\osm\OSM).  You will need to pass the constructor an API Id and Token
which have been issued to you (as developer) by OSM support.  The Id and Token
are unique to your application and and identify it to the API.</p>
<p>The next step is to pass a login name and password to your object's Login
method.  This will succeed if the login name and password are valid for normal
online use of OSM, either as a parent or as a leader.</p>

<h2>Navigating the world of OSM</h2>
<p>Once you are logged in, the OSM object will give you access to a few global
properties such as:</p>
<ul><li>a list of your own children
    <li>a list of sections which you can access as a leader
    <li>your current section (most recently viewed through the web interface)
</ul>
<p>You can also find some objects by their ID (often you need a section ID as
well).</p>
<p>There is no need explicitly to query the API, simply access the relevent
object property and the queries will be performed behind the scenes.  Results of
queries are cached to minimise the number of API calls that have to be made.</p>
<p>Most other objects are accessed through a term or a scout, although since
each section has a default term you can often avoid worrying about terms.</p>
<p>For example, from a term we can get a list of scouts active in that term or a
list of events in that term.  From a scout we can get a list of badges they have
worked on or a list of events they have attended.</p>

<h1 id=classes>Classes, properties and Methods</h1>
<p>Detailed information about the classes, their public and private properties
and methods is given in the <a href=../refdocs/index.html>reference documentation</a>.
Here we give a brief description of the use of the various classes.</p>

<h2>Class OSM</h2>
<h3>Public Properties</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>myChildren</td><td>array of Scouts for whom the logged in user is
parent</td></tr>
<tr><td>section</td><td>the current section.  If the logged-in user has leader's
access to OSM this will initially be the section they last viewed.  Otherwise it
will be null until changed by a call to SetSection.
<tr><td>sections</td><td>array of Sections to which the logged-in user has
leader access</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Public Methods</h3>
<table>
<tr><td>new OSM( $apiId, $token )</td>
    <td>Returns an OSM object (one would rarely want more than one) which can be
    used to log in and read information from OSM.  Information fetched from OSM
    will be cached to avoid multiple calls for the same information but the
    cache will be discarded if you log out or discard the OSM object (for
    example, when the script exits).</td></tr>
<tr><td>PersistantOSM( $apiId, $token )</td>
    <td>Returns an OSM object which, provided a PHP session is available, will
    persist the cache across multiple pages.  This usefully reduces the load on
    the OSM web servers where people might be viewing several pages which draw
    on overlapping information.  However, the cache can get out of date unless
    method <a href=#osm_ClearCache
    title='Method ClearCache in this document'>ClearCache</a> is called or login
    is repeated.</td></tr>
</table>
